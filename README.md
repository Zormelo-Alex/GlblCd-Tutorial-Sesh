<!-- <h3>This project was a group project</h3>
<p>It was given to my team by a course lecturer, we were to follow the processes of software engineering and come up with a system to solve a real life prolem.</p>
<p>After thorough investigation, we settled on building a morden and technological management system to aid our local school clinic in managing patient and user data to enable ease of service and quick access to data.</p>

<h3>Requirement Gathering</h3>
<p>We embarked on a quest to find the requirements a clinic management system would need, we visited our local clinic for those purposes... we interviewed a few patients and members of their staff and came up with a few...</p>
<ul>
<li>Login and authentication</li>
<li>Searching patients by name and ID</li>
<li>Managing Staff schedule</li>
<li>Taking and storing patient and user data</li>
<li>Security of data</li>
<li>Quick response</li>
<li>Easy to understand and navigate</li>
<li>Clear fonts and adequate spacing</li>
</ul>

<h3>Product Development</h3>
<p>We quickly started work on the project, our prefered model for development was Rapid Application Development(RAD), since it is an agile method and allows for an easy iterative process and quick delivery of softare prduct.</p>
<p>In no time we developed a funtioning prototype with a few requirements implmented and begun testing to find more requirements and also better old requirements...</p>
